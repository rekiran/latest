I'm currently an Engineer at Upstatement building things for the web with some awesome people. I recently graduated from Northeastern 
University after completing three awesome six-month co-ops at MullenLowe U.S., Starry, and Apple Music.
As a software engineer, I enjoy bridging the gap between engineering and design â€” combining my technical knowledge with my keen eye for design to create a beautiful product. My goal is to always build applications that are scalable and efficient under the hood while providing engaging, pixel-perfect user experiences.
